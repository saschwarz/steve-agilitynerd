reading the list on smart phones or on digest begging people to trim
their email posts. I always trim my emails, so I normally just ignore
those emails. I think it is rude and inconsiderate to not trim an email
reply. It is just expected on tech email lists to be a good email
citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is always some one who just can't &amp;quot;get with the program&amp;quot;. Sure
enough, a little while later an email comes by saying, effectively: &amp;quot;I
use some crappy email program that doesn't let me trim my posts. So why
don't you just click the delete button or just skip past the emails if
they are too long&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evil Steve wanted to reply with: &amp;quot;Thanks for the heads up! I've just
black listed your email address so I never have to read your emails
again&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I replied letting them know that digest readers don't have that
luxury.&lt;/p&gt;

last year... It also started to drop video frames during recording. So I
ordered a new HD Panasonic camcorder and just got it delivered. I'm
surprised at how small it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dug out my first camcorder (which I still have for some reason...) and
took this picture of the AgilityNerd video recorder evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll give it a try at the agility trial this weekend and see how it
works...&lt;/p&gt;
