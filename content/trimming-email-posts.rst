Trimming Email Posts

I was reading a non-tech email list the other day and there were people
reading the list on smart phones or on digest begging people to trim
their email posts. I always trim my emails, so I normally just ignore
those emails. I think it is rude and inconsiderate to not trim an email
reply. It is just expected on tech email lists to be a good email
citizen.

But there is always some one who just can't "get with the program". Sure
enough, a little while later an email comes by saying, effectively: "I
use some crappy email program that doesn't let me trim my posts. So why
don't you just click the delete button or just skip past the emails if
they are too long".

The evil Steve wanted to reply with: "Thanks for the heads up! I've just
black listed your email address so I never have to read your emails
again".

Instead I replied letting them know that digest readers don't have that
luxury.
