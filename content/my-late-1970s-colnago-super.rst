I worked my way through high school and college as a bicycle mechanic at
the "The Cycle Scene" bike shop down the street from our house starting
in the late 1970s. I was a bike nerd back then and spent most of the
money I earned on bike parts. During that time I built my dream bike:

I can't remember when I bought the frame, it was 77 or 78. The bike has
had a number of mods over it's lifetime. I built several sets of wheels
around the small flange Campy Nuovo hubs. I rode sewups/tubulars for a
while. I had the current wheels built by Performance bikes in the 1990s
and they probably have less than 100 miles on them. I had lost the bike
bug by then...

Here is the current list parts list for any old school road bike fans
out there:

-  63 cm Black Colnago Super frameset
-  Campagnolo Nuovo Headset
-  Cinelli Record Stem
-  Cinelli Giro D'Italia bars
-  Hand stitched leather bar wraps
-  Galli Ti (titanium bolt) short reach brakes with Mathauser brake pads
-  Colnago "panto" engraved Campagnolo Nuovo brake levers
-  Campagnolo Nuovo shifters and Super Record front deraileur
-  Colnago engraved Campagnolo Super Record crankset with 46/42
   chainrings.
-  O.M.A.S. sealed bearing bottom bracket with titanium spindle.
-  Weyless sealed bearing pedals with Colnago decalled alloy toe clips,
   Binda straps
-  Campagnolo Super Record rear deraileur with red anodyzed aluminum
   Bullseye sealed bearing pulleys
-  Colnago engraved Campagnolo Nuovo(?) seat post
-  Avocet saddle (I've probably had a dozen saddles on this bike over
   the years)
-  Performance dual seat mount bottle cages
-  Sedis chain (had a nicer chain at one point)
-  Shimano alloy freewheel (many Italian freewheels over the years)
-  Wheels are Campagnolo Nuovo small flange with chrome butted DT
   spokes, black anodized aluminum nipples, Mavic MA40 700c hard
   anodized (clincher) rims with 1" Performance tires.
-  Yellow frame fit Silca pump.
-  Yellow teflon lined cable housings.
-  Mount for Cateye computer with cadence and rear wheel speedometer.

It needs a complete overhaul it hasn't had any maintenance in 15+ years.

I took it for a quick spin around the block probably five years ago and
I still love how stiff it is for a large steel tube frame. Each push of
the pedals and the bike lept foward. Thinking about it almost makes me
want to do the overhaul and ride it again...
