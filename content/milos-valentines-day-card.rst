`Milo`_Â gave me this Valentine's day card:

Actually Nancy modified the original card which had a picture of a
generic brown dog. Through careful application of whiteout and black
sharpie she transmogrified the dog into a "frowzy" border collie just
like Milo.

I know Milo would share his chocolate covered tennis ball with me; or at
least drop the juicy, chocolately mess in my lap...
