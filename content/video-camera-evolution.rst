I got tired of the noise my Sony video camera has been making for the
last year... It also started to drop video frames during recording. So I
ordered a new HD Panasonic camcorder and just got it delivered. I'm
surprised at how small it is!

I dug out my first camcorder (which I still have for some reason...) and
took this picture of the AgilityNerd video recorder evolution.

I'll give it a try at the agility trial this weekend and see how it
works...
