</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Five or so years ago I put in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flor.com">FLOR</a> carpet tiles in my living room. I liked the color scheme and figured they would be long lasting. I installed them as a floating floor - the oak floor is visible around the edges of the carpet.</p>
<div class="thumbnail clear">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37642750@N00/8539276253/" title="FLOR House Pet in the Living Room by mrpandmilo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8384/8539276253_d02ebdcfd6.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="FLOR House Pet in the Living Room"></a>
</div><p>I also liked that I could pull them up in case of dog accidents or mess making on my part. All was well for a few years.</p>
<p>Then I found that I couldn't reposition the tiles after pulling them up - they wouldn't stay in place. I had to buy/use more <cite>FLOR-dots</cite> (the sticky plastic tape squares that stick the tiles to one another) each time I pulled a tile up for cleaning. It was getting expensive to keep buying more dots. Pretty soon 50% of my tiles had gaps on the edges and would go flying with any dog activity.</p>
<p>So I went to contact customer support. I don't like spending time on the phone waiting for customer support. So when I found no email addresses on the website... (really?) I filled out the contact customer support form. I received an automated response that I'd hear back in two days. Two weeks later no reply - filled it out again - same automated response. Waited a week and still no reply.</p>
<p>I finally called and was passed along to someone's voice mail. I was really not happy at this point. The next day I received a call from a customer support person. I explained my problem and my unhappiness with my customer support experience. They apologized and told me that they had been having problems with the old formulation of FLOR-dots not sticking to the backing of the House Pet tiles... Clearly what I was experiencing.</p>
<p>So the nice woman (wish I could remember her name) had a whole pile of the new dots sent out to me in a couple days at no charge. It took about an hour to pull up the tiles that had gaps and re-dot them. No gaps and no flying tiles!</p>
<p>First off, thanks to FLOR for &quot;making it right&quot;. Secondly, in this age of always connected people, it should be easy for customers to contact a company electronically - email addresses should be visible and easily accessible on the website. The spam argument doesn't cut it - companies have to suck it up and handle their email. Lastly, if a company really feels the need to have an impersonal contact form, someone has to actually be responsible for handling the contacts that come through it!</p>
